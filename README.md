Server Application:
The server application in this scenario is responsible for handling OTP requests, generating OTP codes, and verifying the OTP codes submitted by clients.

Functionality:

OTP Generation: The server generates OTP codes and sends them to clients upon request.
OTP Verification: Upon receiving OTP codes from clients, the server verifies them to authenticate the client's identity.
Implementation:

The server application would typically be implemented using server-side technologies such as Node.js, Python Flask, or Java Spring.
It would include logic for generating OTP codes, managing client requests, and verifying OTP codes.
The server would expose endpoints for clients to request OTP codes and submit OTP codes for verification.
Client Application:
The client application interacts with the server to request OTP codes, submit OTP codes for verification, and display relevant information to the user.

Functionality:

Requesting OTP: The client allows users to input their phone numbers and request OTP codes from the server.
Verifying OTP: Once the user receives the OTP code, they input it into the client application, which then sends it to the server for verification.
Displaying Information: The client may display relevant information such as IP address, server status, or verification status to the user.
Implementation:

The client application could be developed for Android using Java or Kotlin.
It would include UI components like EditText for phone number input, buttons for requesting and verifying OTP, and TextView for displaying information.
The client would communicate with the server using HTTP requests, sending requests to the server's endpoints and handling responses accordingly.
It would handle user interactions, such as button clicks, and update the UI based on server responses.
Overall, this layout provides a basic interface for the client application, allowing users to interact with the server for OTP generation and verification purposes.
